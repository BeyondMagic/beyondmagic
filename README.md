Hello, my real name is Jo√£o Farias and I love to write latest language-standard code.

And while programming is my passion I have a spot in my heart for mathematics and design, and working with all three is where I thrive.

I like to share what I learn and how I do it, eventually I plan to put up my thoughts in a digital garden.

I have fun doing competitive programming racing to the top; and working on free and open source software where everyone can benefit from.

If you are asking which languages I program the most, I'd say any I need to. Programming languages are only tools for one's mind, that's a lesson I'll always believe.
