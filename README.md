Hello, my real name is Jo√£o Farias and I like to write practical code, that of which enables easier real-life tasks.

Programming has been a passion for long four years now, since I was a teenager to now, a young adult; throughout it I met the Mathematics the legends write about, the myths it seeks, it has been great learning, truly learning it.

I learned to love visual art of the many types: drawing, painting, designing; linguistics and philosophies also have made me change the way I see much of the world.

Overall, I'd say I like to share what I learn, and one day, I plan to put up many of my thoughts in a digital garden.

As you will see from my repositories and contributions, I like to work on [free and open source software](https://www.fsf.org/) where everyone can benefit from.

I also have fun doing competitive programming!
